# Medical Diagnosis Decision Tree Project

# Description:
The "Medical Diagnosis Decision Tree" project is a sophisticated application designed to assist in automated medical condition prediction based on provided symptoms. The project leverages a dataset containing disease-symptom descriptions, acquired from Kaggle. The primary goal of this project is to facilitate accurate disease diagnosis by analyzing user-input symptoms and employing a decision tree algorithm to predict potential medical conditions.

# Key characteristics:

The study uses a carefully constructed decision tree to identify the relationship between symptoms and suspected medical disorders. In order to create accurate predictions, the algorithm learns from the dataset.
User Interaction: Users can enter a list of symptoms through a user-friendly web interface created with Streamlit. The system analyzes this data and forecasts the most probable disease.
Data Preprocessing: To prepare the dataset for decision tree training and prediction, the project preprocesses the data. Diseases act as labels, and symptoms are represented as features.
Learning from Decision Trees The project is driven by two primary files: "implement.py" and "library.py." These scripts use a custom decision tree implementation and the decision tree classifier from the Scikit-Learn package to discover patterns in the data.
Accurate Predictions: The project demonstrates high accuracy in predicting diseases based on input symptoms, offering a valuable tool for preliminary medical condition assessment.
